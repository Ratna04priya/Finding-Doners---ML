# Finding-Doners---ML
## Implementing and Using the Supervised Algorithms 

In this project,we are using a dataset of census.csv and implementing the supervised algorithm on that data.

We are basically using sklearn module for this unsupervised learning.
## Sklearn :

*Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.*
It has various submodules which can implement -
> 1. Classification
> 2. Regression
